# Overview

AgentCallValidator is a JavaScript-based project designed to support my growth as a software engineer by exploring automation, text processing, and quality assurance concepts.

The purpose of this software is to serve as the foundation for a tool that analyzes customer service interactions and validates whether agents follow predefined compliance rules. While this initial version is a simple "Hello World" application, it establishes the project structure and development environment that will be expanded in future iterations.

Through this project, I aim to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, project organization, and professional software development workflows using Git and GitHub.
